// 9. Create a Sentence with a Time and Place
// You have two variables: time and place. Concatenate them into a sentence like: "The meeting is at [time] in [place]." 
// For example, if time = "3 PM" and place = "the conference room", the result should be: "The meeting is at 3 PM in the conference room.".

let time = "3 PM";
let place = "the conference room";
console.log("The meeting is at "+time+" in "+place+".");
