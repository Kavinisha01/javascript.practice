// 5. Create a Simple Introduction
// Write a program that takes two variables, name and age, and forms a sentence that introduces the person. 
// For example, if name = "Emma" and age = 25, the program should print: "Hi, my name is Emma and I am 25 years old.".

let name1 = "Emma";
let age = 25;
let sentence = `Hi, my name is ${name1} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(sentence);
